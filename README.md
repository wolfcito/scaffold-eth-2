# Scaffold Mode Network for better workshop experience

## Quickstart

To get started, follow the steps below:

### Option 1

```shell
npx scaffold-mode-network dapp-name
```

### Option 2

Clone this repo & install dependencies

```shell
git clone git@github.com:wolfcito/scaffold-mode-network.git
cd scaffold-mode-network
yarn install
```

### Important

You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

### 1. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract (Optional)

```shell
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

### 2. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app

```shell
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`.

You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

**What's next**:

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
- Edit your smart contract test in: `packages/hardhat/test`. To run test use `yarn hardhat:test`
